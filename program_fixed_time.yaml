  description: Used in situation with high traffic volumes towards the city.
  control_mode: fixed     # the overall control strategy, can be fixed, isolated, actuated, coordinated or adaptive
  cycle_time: 80       # used only in fixed and coordinated mode
  commands:
    # A consise format where you define when groups start and stop
    # You must stop conflicting groups.
    # The start/stop time is when transition starts, e.g. yellow or red-yellow.
    # The controller uses configs for yellow tines to handle the transitions.
    # Start/stop depends on the group, e.g. green/red, or flash/dark.
    # You can write illegal progams, the controller will always respect conflict matrix to
    # prevent e.g. green in conflicting diretions.

    # An basic example:
    0: { "start": ["a1","a2"], "stop": ["b1", "b2"] }
    40: { "stop": ["a1","a2"], "start": ["b1", "b2"] }

    # An example with longer integreen times for b2 (it stays red for longer).
    0: { "start": ["a1","a2"], "stop": ["b1", "b2"] }
    40: { "stop": ["a1","a2"], "start": ["b1"] }
    50: { "start": ["b2"] }

# RSMP TLC Programming

This repository is used for work on making programming Traffic Light Controllers easier and more vendor-neutral.

## RSMP TCL Signal Program Specification
Work will include drafting an open RSMP specification for Traffic Light Controller programs.

The goal is to create common data structures containing traffic programming parameters and
describe the way these parameters should be interpreted traffic light controllers.

Identical behaviour should be produced pon on any controller executing it, given the same detector and communication input.

See the [overview](overview.md).
